Since the AI boom on the internet has been trending and creating new ways to unlock powerful technologies, I always wanted to create an app that utilizes the powerful models provided by one of the leading techs in AI, OpenAI. Hence, here it goes SocialAI, an image-sharing social media app. Imagine Instagram with all its features combined with the wonders of AI models that enable users to unlock or work as catalysts adding a creative curve to their social existence.
<br />
The project was created using my favorite framework for React - NextJs with TypeScript as its principal language, for creating UI components and structurize backend for API calls. Cloudinary, a media management to store generated images shared by the user. The UI was created using TailwindCSS and plugins from npm (Node Package Manager). For form validation and submissions, react-hook-form is used. The entire state is centralized with redux-toolkit, async thunks for asynchronous API calls, and state management. A custom hook like useDebounce to limit the overflow of API calls was created to enable the search feature of other images shared in the community of the app.

## Screens

- Home page as images shared by other users
- Create post for generating image from prompt
- Download button for save images
